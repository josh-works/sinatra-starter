# A Tiny Sinatra Learning Project

I wanted to figure out some basics, like:

1. How to spin up a bare-bones sinatra app
2. Minimum-viable-views
3. How to read/display somewhat randomized data
4. How to deploy the whole thing to Heroku

And... I've done that. I can now do all of the above steps in about fifteen minutes.

Things I wrote as I made this tiny app:

- [Sinatra Basics: part 1 (Intermediatruby.com)](https://intermediateruby.com/sinatra-basics)
- [github.com/josh-works/til/sinatra](https://github.com/josh-works/til/tree/main/sinatra)
